This repository is connected to an R project that was created for the purposes of a private course regarding the Geospatial Data Processing in R Programming Language (in Czech Zpracování geodat v programovacím jazyce R; _zgr_). The main rationale here is sharing 40 example scripts making use of the {sf}, {terra} and other R packages dedicated to working with geospatial data (geodata) in R. Since further development of such packages is evisaged, a version control is needed. For more infomation about the course (in Czech), see https://www.datova-akademie.cz/kurzy/zpracovani-geodat-v-programovacim-jazyce-r/.
Note: This course is taught in Czech, so also the Czech accents are included in the script comments. File encoding is UTF-8. Course material for English-speaking scientists can be found in the _gpr_ repository (see also https://www.datova-akademie.cz/kurzy/geospatial-data-processing-in-r/). The main license of the work is described in the LICENSE file. When it comes to the use of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (CHMI) data or metadata, what is described in the LICENSE.data file applies.
