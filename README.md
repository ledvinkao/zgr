This repository is connected to an R project that was created for the purposes of a private course regarding the Geospatial Data Processing in R Programming Lanuage (in Czech Zpracování geodat v programovacím jazyce R; _zgr_). The main rationale here is sharing 40 example scripts making use of the {sf}, {terra} and other R packages dedicated to working with geospatial data (geodata) in R. Since further development of such packages is evisaged, a version control is needed. For more infomation about the course (in Czech), see https://www.datova-akademie.cz/kurzy/zpracovani-geodat-v-programovacim-jazyce-r/.
Note: This course is taught in Czech, so also the Czech accents are included in the script comments. File encoding is UTF-8. A course for English-speaking scientists is being prepared as well (see https://www.datova-akademie.cz/kurzy/geospatial-data-processing-in-r/).
